# Pump.fun Risks

Pump.fun is a platform for launching meme coins on Solana with a bonding curve mechanism.

## Specific Risks

- **98.7% of tokens exhibit pump-and-dump characteristics** (per research)
- **Anonymous creators**: No KYC or verification
- **No liquidity locks**: Creators can drain at any time
- **Bonding curve manipulation**: Prices can be manipulated
- **High failure rate**: Most tokens lose value quickly
- **Exit scams**: Creators disappear with funds

## Mitigation

- Wait for migration to Raydium (more established DEX)
- Check creator renunciation
- Monitor for suspicious trading patterns
- Use tools like RugCheck before investing
- Start with small amounts

Pump.fun tokens are speculative and high-risk by nature. Most will fail.</content>
